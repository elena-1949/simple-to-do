## Introduction

This guide provides a comprehensive overview of how to develop and run your Visual Studio Code extension. The extension provides a to-do list management system within VS Code, allowing users to interact with tasks via TreeView and WebView. The aim of this extension is to simplify task management directly from within the VS Code environment.

By following this guide, you will understand the core structure of the extension, how to add features, and how to deploy the extension for use in your development environment.

## Installation Prerequisites

Before beginning the development of your extension, ensure the following prerequisites are installed:

### 1. Visual Studio Code
- Download and install the latest version of [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

### 2. Node.js
- You need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed to manage dependencies and run the extension. It includes npm (Node Package Manager), which is essential for installing dependencies.

### 3. Git
- Ensure you have [Git](https://github.com/YasinSa7/simple-to-do.git) installed to clone the repository and version control your project.

## Cloning the Repository

To begin, clone the extension repository to your local development environment. This step ensures you have the latest source code.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YasinSa7/simple-to-do.git
cd todo-vscode-extension


Installing Dependencies
Next, you need to install all the necessary dependencies for the project. In the project folder, open a terminal and run the following command:

bash
Copy code
npm install
This will install all the packages defined in package.json, which includes the necessary libraries for building the extension.

Running the Extension
Once the dependencies are installed, you can run your extension locally in Visual Studio Code.

Open the project folder in Visual Studio Code.
Press F5 to launch the extension in a new VS Code window.
The extension should be activated automatically, and you'll see the task management UI within the new window.
You can now interact with the to-do list system from this new VS Code window.

Exploring the Project Structure
Before diving into development, it's essential to understand the structure of the project. Here's a brief breakdown of the most important files and directories in the project:

lua
Copy code
F:.
|   .gitignore
|   .vscode-test.mjs
|   .vscodeignore
|   CHANGELOG.md
|   eslint.config.mjs
|   extension.js
|   jsconfig.json
|   myTextViewProvider.js
|   package-lock.json
|   package.json
|   README.md
|   todoProvider.js
|   structure.txt
|   vsc-extension-quickstart.md
|   
+---.vscode
|       extensions.json
|       launch.json
|       
+---node_modules
|   |   .package-lock.json
|   
+---resources
|       todo-icon.svg
|       
\---test
        extension.test.js
extension.js: Main entry point for the extension. Handles the activation and deactivation of commands, and registers views.
todoProvider.js: Manages the to-do list tasks and integrates with the TreeView.
myTextViewProvider.js: Handles the WebView for task details and UI interactions.
package.json: Defines the metadata, dependencies, and configurations for the extension.
test/extension.test.js: Contains unit tests for verifying functionality.
Activating the Extension
Once the extension is installed and running, it is activated based on user interactions with the VS Code environment. The extension will listen for specific commands, such as adding, removing, and toggling tasks.

To activate the extension, you can use the command palette:

Press Ctrl+Shift+P (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+Shift+P (Mac) to open the command palette.
Type the name of the command you want to trigger, such as Add New Task, Remove Task, or Toggle Task Completed.
These commands will trigger actions within the extension.

Creating Commands
Commands in a VS Code extension allow you to execute functionality directly from the command palette or context menus. For example, the extension allows adding and removing tasks using the command palette. Here's a breakdown of how the commands are implemented:

Add New Task: Adds a new task to the to-do list.
Remove Task: Removes a specific task from the list.
Toggle Task Completed: Toggles the completion status of a task.
To add a new command, define it in the package.json under the contributes.commands section, and implement its functionality in the extension.js file.

Adding Views
Views are the primary method for displaying task information. The extension uses two types of views:

TreeView: Displays tasks in a hierarchical structure. Tasks can be added, removed, or toggled via TreeView.
WebView: A more interactive and detailed display of tasks. You can use the WebView to show detailed information about each task, such as due dates and descriptions.
To add a new view, use the vscode.window.createTreeView API for TreeView, and the vscode.window.createWebviewPanel for WebView.

Testing the Extension
Testing is essential to ensure that the extension behaves as expected. The test/extension.test.js file contains the test cases for the extension. The tests verify core functionalities such as adding tasks, removing tasks, and toggling task completion.

To run the tests:

Install testing dependencies by running npm install --save-dev mocha chai.
Run the tests using the following command:
bash
Copy code
npm test
Debugging
To debug the extension, open the Debug panel in Visual Studio Code:

Set breakpoints in your code.
Press F5 to launch the extension in debug mode.
Use the Debug Console to inspect the state of your extension as it runs.
Debugging can help you troubleshoot issues and ensure the extension behaves as expected.

Publishing the Extension
Once your extension is ready for release, you can publish it to the Visual Studio Code Marketplace.

To publish:

Install the vsce CLI tool:
bash
Copy code
npm install -g vsce
Package the extension:
vsce package
Publish the extension:
vsce publish
Follow the prompts to complete the publishing process.

Conclusion
This guide has provided you with the necessary steps to develop, test, and deploy your Visual Studio Code extension. By following these steps, you can extend and modify the functionality of your extension to fit your needs. If you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to reach out or open an issue in the repository.

Good luck with your extension development!

# Welcome to your VS Code Extension

## What's in the folder

* This folder contains all of the files necessary for your extension.
* `package.json` - this is the manifest file in which you declare your extension and command.
  * The sample plugin registers a command and defines its title and command name. With this information VS Code can show the command in the command palette. It doesnâ€™t yet need to load the plugin.
* `extension.js` - this is the main file where you will provide the implementation of your command.
  * The file exports one function, `activate`, which is called the very first time your extension is activated (in this case by executing the command). Inside the `activate` function we call `registerCommand`.
  * We pass the function containing the implementation of the command as the second parameter to `registerCommand`.

## Get up and running straight away

* Press `F5` to open a new window with your extension loaded.
* Run your command from the command palette by pressing (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac) and typing `Hello World`.
* Set breakpoints in your code inside `extension.js` to debug your extension.
* Find output from your extension in the debug console.

## Make changes

* You can relaunch the extension from the debug toolbar after changing code in `extension.js`.
* You can also reload (`Ctrl+R` or `Cmd+R` on Mac) the VS Code window with your extension to load your changes.

## Explore the API

* You can open the full set of our API when you open the file `node_modules/@types/vscode/index.d.ts`.
